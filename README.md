CODEN

CODEN is a modern social platform built for developers to connect, share, and build real software together.

It is designed as a developer-first network, focusing on skills, projects, and collaboration — not vanity metrics.

🚀 Vision

Create the leading global social operating system for developers.

CODEN is not another chat app or forum. It is a professional environment where:

Code equals identity

Contribution builds reputation

Collaboration creates value
